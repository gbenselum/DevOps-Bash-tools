# AWS Scripts

This directory contains scripts for managing AWS resources.

- `aws_profile.sh` - switches to an AWS Profile selected from a convenient interactive menu list of AWS profiles from `$AWS_CONFIG_FILE` - useful when you have lots of AWS work profiles
- `aws_cli_create_credential.sh` - creates an AWS service account user for CI/CD or CLI with Admin permissions (or other group or policy), creates an AWS Access Key, saves a credentials CSV and even prints the shell export commands and aws credentials file config to configure your environment to start using it. Useful trick to avoid CLI reauth to `aws sso login` every day.
- `aws_terraform_create_credential.sh` - creates a AWS terraform service account with Administrator permissions for Terraform Cloud or other CI/CD systems to run Terraform plan and apply, since no CI/CD systems can work with AWS SSO workflows. Stores the access key as both CSV and prints shell export commands and credentials file config as above
- `.envrc-aws` - copy to `.envrc` for [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to auto-load AWS configuration settings such as AWS Profile, Compute Region, EKS cluster kubectl context etc.
- `aws_sso_ssh.sh` - launches local AWS SSO authentication pop-up (if not already authenticated), then scp's the latest resultant `~/.aws/sso/cache/` file to the remote server and SSH's there so that you can use AWS CLI or kubectl to EKS remotely on that server easily, without having to copy and paste the token from remote aws sso login to your local web browser
- `aws_terraform_create_s3_bucket.sh` - creates a Terraform S3 bucket for storing the backend state, locks out public access, enables versioning, encryption, and locks out Power Users role and optionally any given user/group/role ARNs via a bucket policy for safety

- `aws_terraform_create_all.sh` - runs all of the above, plus also applies the custom DynamoDB IAM policy to the user to ensure if the account is less privileged it can still get the Terraform lock (useful for GitHub Actions environment secret for a read only user to generate Terraform Plans in Pull Request without needing approval)
- `aws_terraform_iam_grant_s3_dynamodb.sh` - creates IAM policies to access any S3 buckets and DynamoDB tables with `terraform-state` or `tf-state` in their names, and attaches them to the given user. Useful for limited permissions CI/CD accounts that run Terraform Plan eg. in GitHub Actions pull requests
